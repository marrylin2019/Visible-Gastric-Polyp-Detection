# Visible-Gastric-Polyp-Detection

## DICLEARATION

This project uses the very beginning edition of [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and [UNet++](https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-nested-unet) as two segment model and [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) as object detection model. Meanwhile, the [PyQt Fluent Widgets on PyQt6 branch](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Fluent-Widgets/tree/PyQt6) was chosen to modify the GUI. 

Because of the inexpert of using git, I did not fork these project mentioned above. I give thanks to these project here.

This is a project which help me graduate.
